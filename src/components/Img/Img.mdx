# Img

import Img from './Img'
import { Playground, PropsTable } from 'docz'
import faker from 'faker'

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Img} />

### Responsive

Make the image shrink and grow with its container by adding the `responsive` prop:

<Playground>
  <Img
    responsive
    src={faker.image.nature(800, 600)}
    alt="nature"
    width="800"
    height="600"
  />
</Playground>

### Fit

Let the image contain its ratio by setting the `fit` prop to `contain` or let it cover its surface by setting it to `cover`:

<Playground>
  <Img
    responsive
    fit="contain"
    src={faker.image.nature(800, 600)}
    alt="nature"
    width="800"
    height="600"
    style={{ height: 500, width: 500 }}
  />
  <Img
    responsive
    fit="cover"
    src={faker.image.nature(800, 600)}
    alt="nature"
    width="800"
    height="600"
    style={{ height: 500, width: 500 }}
  />
</Playground>
